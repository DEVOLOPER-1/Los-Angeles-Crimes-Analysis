# Crimes in Los Angeles - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🕵️‍♂️

## Overview 📊
Welcome to the repository for the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **Crimes in Los Angeles** dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudhanvahg/crimes-in-las-angeles/code). This project involves data scraping, cleaning, and visualization to uncover insights about crime patterns in Los Angeles.

## Project Steps 🚀
### 1. Data Scraping 📥
The dataset was retrieved using the Kaggle API token, ensuring an automated and up-to-date data extraction process.

### 2. Data Cleaning 🧼
- **Pandas**: Used for initial data manipulation and cleaning.
- **PyJanitor**: Assisted in further cleaning tasks, such as removing null values, renaming columns, and filtering data.

### 3. Initial EDA with LangChain API 🧠
Attempted to use the LangChain API to perform initial EDA, but it did not yield satisfactory results.

### 4. Advanced Analysis with Pandas Sketch 🔍
Leveraged Pandas Sketch to analyze the dataframe and receive recommendations based on specific queries, leading to more insightful EDA.

### 5. Data Refinement ✨
The dataset was large and required additional cleaning. New dataframes were generated with specific re-cleansed columns, applying custom conditionals to ensure data accuracy and relevance.

### 6. Visualization with Streamlit 📈
The refined data was visualized using a Streamlit dashboard, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface to explore the analysis results.

## Results 🏆
The EDA revealed significant insights into crime patterns in Los Angeles, such as:
- Trends over time ⏳
- Geographic hotspots 🗺️
- Crime types and frequencies 📝
